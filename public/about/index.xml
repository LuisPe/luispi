      <description>Hi üëãüèº In the blog you will find reflections and learnings about my life in general.
I do not pretend to be an example of anything or anyone, the opinions I leave here are mine, I hope not to offend anyone with them.
My name is Luis Pedro -luispe- I am 38 years old, I was born and raised in Gonnet, a town in La Plata, BsAs, Argentina. From my childhood I keep a ton of friends with whom I have shared 35 years, now that I am writing this is crazy.</description>

have the strange habit of publishing success stories (opinion of the writer, wrongly called successful case) and few, if any, occasions where mistakes are shared (opinion of the writer, wrongly called failure).\nAs you might be suspecting below I am going to share some mistakes, which I learned from them and even more how much I grew and understood about the industry by sharing them.\nLesson 1: Write a step-by-step, share it, validate and re-validate it before executing anything\nMy first productive development was in 2012 (?) approximately, it was a website for a company that needed to publish its product catalog, I list technologies to have some context:\ndigitalocean, just released, in addition to the droplets, I don‚Äôt know how many more products I had in my portfolio angular js (angular 1) I think nodeJS for the backend This development was done with one of the people I respect and admire the most, Victor De Grandis -Vitor-.\nMy experience configuring servers was null, I had the delirious idea of telling Vitor:\n_my friend, can I set up the server and then you try to break it?\nThen I started to make several configurations, among them I started to play with the ports, until I proudly told him:\nVitor, try to see what happens.\nAfter a while I receive a message,\nmy friend, could it be that you closed port 22?\nBeautiful, I left the house, locked the door and threw the key into a pond.\nAs the digitalocean people are prepared for people like this writer, they have a feature that if accessed from the web (I have no idea how to solve it from behind) you can run a terminal in the browser and access the droplet.\nI reconfigured the ports, and the rest is history.\nLesson 2: Document knowledge, no matter how trivial we consider it, and invite others to do the same. In addition to avoiding several ‚Äúknowledge transfer‚Äù meetings, we will save several arrobas, remind you anything?\n@fulanito may be able to help you\nIn another team that I had the fortune to work in, small in number of people but from which I learned a lot, a lot from each one of them, unfortunately the adventure was very short in time.\nWhat I did find very strange as one by one people were leaving the team is that we were losing a lot of knowledge to the point of stopping engines (literally) and going weeks without delivering features to production because we had to sit down and figure out how to leave that local line of code and expose it to the internet.\nWhat mistakes did I detect and what did I learn?\nDocument knowledge, however trivial we may consider it, document it.\nOr perhaps, and I invite you to think for a few seconds, did you find yourself one or more times holding ‚Äúknowledge transfer‚Äù meetings because someone was leaving the team?\nOr was it you who was leaving him?\nLesson 3: Job promotions should not be the only or the main objective, but the guide should be to share and acquire knowledge.\nLesson 3 bis:\nThinking and testing before implementing anything is a fundamental guide to understanding the behavior of our systems or the domain knowledge we have so far. Always, and let‚Äôs repeat, always, it is a gain in time.\nFinally, and in another place I worked, I met one of the best problem solvers, Juan Moreno, what is better for me, simple solutions to complex problems.\nAfter this small parenthesis and dedication to the person who today is one of my sources of consultation, I will try to explain teaching number 3 and 3 bis.\nIn pre-pandemic times, I used to - a habit I still have from afar - start early, having a couple of hours ‚Äúalone‚Äù allows me to focus and prioritize as much as possible the things I want to do and have committed to do.\nOne of those mornings and as a consequence of a functionality that we were developing in the team, the leader arrived a little angry (to be kind) and grabbed the first ones he found from the team, thus being able to vent his anger because he had ‚Äúlooked bad‚Äù to his superiors because of all the casuistry there was a case that broke.\nFamous Take a breath and after a few minutes I joined him alone, I asked him a question:\nhow many people are involved in this functionality?\nHe understood with the question that he should have waited and told the whole team responsible what had happened and not grabbed the first people who crossed his path.\nFinally, I told him that I understood but did not share his anger or how he had handled it.\nI want to clarify that my intention is not to judge, but to share that I learned from that mistake, again:\nJob promotions should not be the only or main goal, you run the risk of being under enormous pressure not to rise to the occasion. Sharing and acquiring knowledge should be the guide.\nThinking and testing before implementing anything is the fundamental guide to understanding the behavior of our systems or the domain knowledge we have so far. Always, and let‚Äôs repeat, always, it is a gain in time.\nTo conclude, I understand that I will continue to make mistakes and share the experience they left me with, that does not make me any worse or better than anyone else.\nI am convinced that it is a healthy way of going through life where the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù thing to do is to be ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù or as I like to make parallels with soccer, ‚Äúplaying for the stands‚Äù, but at the end of the day it is only an appearance.\nThank you for reading! üëãüèΩ\n","wordCount":"981","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-06-05T21:53:34-03:00","dateModified":"2022-06-05T21:53:34-03:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"luispe"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://luispe.github.io/blog/posts/mistakes-and-learnings/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"luispe","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://luispe.github.io/blog/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://luispe.github.io/blog/ accesskey=h title="luispe (Alt + H)">luispe</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li><li><a href=https://luispe.github.io/blog/es/ title=es aria-label=es>es</a></li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://luispe.github.io/blog/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://luispe.github.io/blog/posts/ title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li><li><a href=https://luispe.github.io/blog/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://luispe.github.io/blog/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://luispe.github.io/blog/>Home</a>&nbsp;¬ª&nbsp;<a href=https://luispe.github.io/blog/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>You learn from your mistakes, and if you share them, you grow.</h1><div class=post-description>Sharing and acquiring knowledge should be the guide.</div><div class=post-meta>&lt;span title='2022-06-05 21:53:34 -0300 -0300'>June 5, 2022&lt;/span>&amp;nbsp;¬∑&amp;nbsp;5 min&amp;nbsp;¬∑&amp;nbsp;luispe&nbsp;|&nbsp;Translations:<ul class=i18n_list><li><a href=https://luispe.github.io/blog/es/posts/mistakes-and-learnings/>es</a></li></ul></div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#lesson-1 aria-label="Lesson 1:">Lesson 1:</a></li><li><a href=#lesson-2 aria-label="Lesson 2:">Lesson 2:</a></li><li><a href=#lesson-3 aria-label="Lesson 3:">Lesson 3:</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>In our society in general and in technology in particular, we have the strange habit of publishing success

In the blog you will find reflections and learnings about my life in general.

I do not pretend to be an example of anything or anyone, the opinions I leave here are mine, 
I hope not to offend anyone with them.

My name is Luis Pedro -luispe- I am 38 years old, I was born and raised in Gonnet, a town in La Plata, BsAs, Argentina. 
From my childhood I keep a ton of friends with whom I have shared 35 years, now that I am writing this is crazy. 
They are my guide and my grounding cable, if I am what I am it is in part thanks to them and my family ‚ù§Ô∏è

Since I was very young I played soccer in the club Gimnasia y Esgrima de La Plata, after many years when 
I was in the 7th division I had to make the decision if soccer was going to be my professional destiny or a sport, 
the decision was to be a sport, this chapter deserves a separate publication.

When I finished high school in La Plata I studied and graduated from the conservatory Gilardo Gilardi 
and at the same time I also graduated from a tertiary jazz school (EMU).

After several albums, recitals and rehearsals I decided to turn my life around and started studying at the UTN (FRLP) 
the career of systems engineering.

In 2012, I started working in technology and thanks to it I made several friends that I still and fortunately keep, 
I will not name them because I'm afraid of forgetting more than one or one.

After several years and now that I am writing it 38 and counting, it is a good time to write, 
I consider it a good channel to channel my feelings that adds to a good wine, music my family and friends.

So, here it goes... I hope you enjoy it!

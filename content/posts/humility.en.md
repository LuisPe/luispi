The last post I wrote was several months ago, to be precise 6 months exactly.

I have some publications in draft, that for one reason or another do not end 
up convince myself, it could be a coincidence of destiny, but after a few weeks 
of vacation I was born to write about a topic that almost without thinking about it, 
about a topic that coincidentally follows in tune with the last I am talking about _humility_.

Uff how difficult to talk about humility without falling or being stuck in a 
place of false humility or pedantic, but well, I insist, I am writing almost without thinking about it.

## Humility

Second of the pillars that I pursue and look for around me, there are three, 
in case you get tired of reading the previous post, I was talking about:
1. [Trust](https://luispe.github.io/blog/posts/career/)
2. Humility
3. Respect

One of the most surprising things that happened to me after I assumed my new role 
in the company is that [Tonga](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gastonirigoyen/) wrote to me, 
I thanked him for the gesture and told him that I was going to continue on the path 
that had led me to the recognition that the company has achieved, 
and I named the pillars that I have just listed.

Six months later, two incredibly shocking things happened, which marked me and almost by way of thanks, 
I want to write them down. I would like to write them down as a thank you.

## I am not a Martian anymore

I do therapy, many years ago, in one of the sessions I commented that I feel like a Martian 
in the software industry, long ago I learned to have fun, but that didn't change the feeling per se.

Why do I say that "I am no longer a Martian"?
A few weeks ago, Tonga in a relaxed talk talked about humility among many other things, 
I was shocked, by the way he spoke, the power of the speech and the amount of things that 
were playing internally, it was the first time in my life that I stopped feeling 
like a Martian in the IT world.

I was deeply moved, I want to thank you and I don't know if you know it, 
but in my universe it is extremely valuable to find people with that way of going through life.

marked me,

thank you,

I'll take it with me forever.

## It is easy to draw a pigeon, the difficult thing is to make it fly and sing

Unfortunately in IT it is easy to find people rushing to get there, no matter the cost, 
believing that by getting there and sitting at "the table" they will have 
more traction power, and no, maybe they lack "the superpower".

Just a little while ago I talked about two incredibly shocking things 
that happened to me recently, let's go with the second one, the superpower.

## The superpower

All human beings at birth have two innate abilities, problem solving and self-expression.

Don't believe me, I ask us a question:

What would happen if a baby, instead of crying when hungry or in pain, would laugh?

We'd all be laughing our asses off, and the baby would either go hungry or no one would bother to deal with the pain.

**Instinctively, we know how to solve problems and express ourselves**.

Why do I say this?, as time goes by and for many different reasons we put on layers of self-censorship, 
and no matter what position or role we have, we lose that superpower of impact to change things,
I insist, no matter what role or position we have.

Hours after I wrote about Tonga, I met with [Die,](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diegoburgos/) 
and we talked about a lot of things, among them "of the superpower".

marked me,

thank you,

I'll take it with me forever.
